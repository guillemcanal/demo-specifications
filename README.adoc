= The Specification pattern applied to a Repository

The Specification pattern consists of reusable business rules which can be composed together and evaluated against one or multiple candidates.

When used with the https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html[Repository pattern], the specification is used to **query** a datasource.

NOTE: Github don't supports the AsciiDoc `include` directive for some obscure reasons, as a result, you won't be able to see the code blocks below ðŸ¤¦ An https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095[issue] is pending on the Github repository to fix that behavior.

== Simple use case

Let's consider a simple `User` model:

[source,php]
----
include::src/Domain/Model/User.php[tags=class,indent=0]
----

**Given** we want to find all `User` matching a business `Specification`, we declare the following interface:

[source,php]
----
include::src/Domain/Repository/UserRepository.php[tags=class,indent=0]
----

**With** the following list of users:

[source,php]
----
include::tests/UserRepositoryTest.php[tags=users,indent=0]
----

**When** combining...

the `IsActive` specification

[source,php]
----
include::src/Domain/Specification/IsActive.php[tags=class,indent=0]
----

with the `WithRole` specification

[source,php]
----
include::src/Domain/Specification/WithRole.php[tags=class,indent=0]
----

**Then** should obtains a list of **admin** `User` which are **active**

[source,php]
----
include::tests/UserRepositoryTest.php[tags=test_active_users,indent=0]
----
